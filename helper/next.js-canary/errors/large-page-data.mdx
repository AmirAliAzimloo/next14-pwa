title: Large Page Data
---

## Why This Error Occurred

One of your pages includes a large amount of page data (>= 128kB). This can negatively impact performance since page data must be parsed by the client before the page is hydrated.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

Reduce the amount of data returned from `getStaticProps`, `getServerSideProps`, or `getInitialProps` to only the essential data to render the page. The default threshold of 128kB can be configured in `largePageDataBytes` if absolutely necessary and the performance implications are understood.

To inspect the props passed to your page, you can inspect the below element's content in your browser devtools:

```bash filename="Terminal"
JSON.parse(document.getElementById("__NEXT_DATA__").textContent)
```
