title: Rewriting to Auto Export or Fallback Dynamic Route
---

## Why This Error Occurred

One of your rewrites in your `next.config.js` point to a [dynamic route](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes) that is automatically statically optimized or is a [fallback SSG page](/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/get-static-paths#getstaticpaths-return-values).

Rewriting to these pages are not yet supported since rewrites are not available client-side and the dynamic route params are unable to be parsed. Support for this may be added in a future release.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

For fallback SSG pages you can add the page to the list of [prerendered paths](/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/get-static-paths#paths).

For static dynamic routes, you will currently need to either rewrite to non-dynamic route or opt the page out of the static optimization with [`getServerSideProps`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-server-side-props)
