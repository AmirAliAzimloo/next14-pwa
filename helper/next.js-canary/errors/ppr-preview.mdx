title: Partial Prerendering Preview in Next.js Canary

## Why This Error Occurred

In your `next.config.js` you enabled `experimental.ppr` but you are not using the latest Next.js canary. To ensure you are experimenting with the latest version, we currently require the use of a canary release.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

- Install `next@canary` (e.g. `npm install next@canary`)
