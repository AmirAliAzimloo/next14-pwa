title: '`getStaticPaths` Used on Non-Dynamic Page'
---

## Why This Error Occurred

On a non-dynamic SSG page `getStaticPaths` was incorrectly exported as this can only be used on dynamic pages to return the paths to prerender.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

Remove the `getStaticPaths` export on the non-dynamic page or rename the page to be a dynamic page.
