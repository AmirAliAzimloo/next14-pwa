title: Reserved Port
---

## Why This Error Occurred

Server was started on a reserved port. For example, `4045` is reserved for the Network Paging Protocol (npp).

```
next start -p 4045
```

or

```
next dev --port 4045
```

Starting the server on a reserved port will result in an error.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

Change the provided port to ensure it's not listed in the [Port Blocking](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#port-blocking) section of WHATWG's fetch spec.
