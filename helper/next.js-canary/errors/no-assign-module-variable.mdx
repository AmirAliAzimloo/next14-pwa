title: No assign module variable

> Prevent assignment to the `module` variable.

## Why This Error Occurred

A value is being assigned to the `module` variable. The `module` variable is already used and it is highly likely that assigning to this variable will cause errors.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

Use a different variable name:

```js filename="example.js"
let myModule = {...}
```
