## Why This Error Occurred

The "404.js Cannot Have `getInitialProps`" error usually occurs when either `getInitialProps` or `getServerSideProps` is used in your `404.js` page. The `404.js` page in Next.js is designed to be static to ensure consistent performance.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

Adding `getInitialProps` or `getServerSideProps` to your `404.js` page will cause it to be rendered on the server-side.

To fix this error, you should remove `getInitialProps` from your `404.js` page. Additionally, ensure that no Higher-Order Components (HOCs) used in the `404.js` page are attaching `getInitialProps`.

If your `404.js` page requires data fetching, we recommend incrementally adopting the App Router and the [`not-found`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/not-found) file, which does support fetching data before displaying the 404 page.
