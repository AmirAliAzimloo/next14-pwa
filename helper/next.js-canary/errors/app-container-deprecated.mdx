title: Addressing "App Container Deprecated" Error in Next.js
description: This document guides developers on how to resolve the "App Container Deprecated" error in Next.js by updating their custom App component.

## Why This Error Occurred

The "App Container Deprecated" error usually occurs when you are using the `<Container>` component in your custom `<App>` (`pages/_app.js`). Prior to version `9.0.4` of Next.js, the `<Container>` component was used to handle scrolling to hashes.

From version `9.0.4` onwards, this functionality was moved up the component tree, rendering the `<Container>` component unnecessary in your custom `<App>`.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

To resolve this issue, you need to remove the `<Container>` component from your custom `<App>` (`pages/_app.js`).

**Before**

```jsx filename="pages/_app.js"
import React from 'react'
import App, { Container } from 'next/app'

class MyApp extends App {
  render() {
    const { Component, pageProps } = this.props
    return (
      <Container>
        <Component {...pageProps} />
      </Container>
    )
  }
}

export default MyApp
```

**After**

```jsx filename="pages/_app.js"
import React from 'react'
import App from 'next/app'

class MyApp extends App {
  render() {
    const { Component, pageProps } = this.props
    return <Component {...pageProps} />
  }
}

export default MyApp
```

After making this change, your custom `<App>` should work as expected without the `<Container>` component.
