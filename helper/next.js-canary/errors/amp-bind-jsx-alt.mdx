## Why This Error Occurred

The "AMP Bind JSX Error" arises when you use the `[prop]='something'` syntax somewhere in your code.

JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript used by React (and by extension, Next.js). JSX does not support the usage of this particular syntax, hence the error.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

To fix this issue, instead of using `[prop]='something'`, you can use `data-amp-bind-prop='something'`. This is a valid alternative in Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) that works well with JSX.
