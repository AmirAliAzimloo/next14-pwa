title: '`NextResponse.next()` used in a App Route Handler'
---

## Why This Error Occurred

App Route Handler's do not currently support using the `NextResponse.next()` method to forward to the next middleware because the handler is considered the endpoint to the middleware chain. Handlers must always return a `Response` object instead.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

Remove the `NextResponse.next()` and replace it with a correct response handler.
