title: 'Mixed `notFound` and `redirect`'
---

## Why This Error Occurred

In one of your page's `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps` `notFound` and `redirect` values were both returned.

These values can not both be returned at the same time and one or the other needs to be returned at a time.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

Make sure only `notFound` **or** `redirect` is being returned on your page's `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps`
