title: '`placeholder=blur` without `blurDataURL`'
---

## Why This Error Occurred

You are attempting use the `next/image` component with `placeholder=blur` property but no `blurDataURL` property.

The `blurDataURL` might be missing because you're using a string for `src` instead of a static import.

Or `blurDataURL` might be missing because the static import is an unsupported image format. Only jpg, png, webp, and avif are supported at this time, though animated images are not supported.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

- Add a [`blurDataURL`](/docs/pages/api-reference/components/image#blurdataurl) property, the contents should be a small Data URL to represent the image
- Change the [`src`](/docs/pages/api-reference/components/image#src) property to a static import with one of the supported file types: jpg, png, webp, or avif (animated images not supported)
- Remove the [`placeholder`](/docs/pages/api-reference/components/image#placeholder) property, effectively no blur effect
