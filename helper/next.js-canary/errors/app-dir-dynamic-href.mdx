## Why This Error Occurred

The "Dynamic `href` is not supported in the App Router" error happens when you try to use a dynamic `href` with `next/link` in the `app` directory.

The new client-side router in Next.js does not use a mapping of dynamic routes to URLs, but rather it leverages the URL directly. This means it doesn't support dynamic `href` use.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

You need to replace the dynamic `href` with a direct path in the `next/link` component. Here's a before and after comparison of what your code should look like:

**Before**

```jsx
<Link
  href={{
    pathname: '/route/[slug]',
    query: { slug: '1' },
  }}
>
  link
</Link>
```

Or

```jsx
<Link href="/route/[slug]?slug=1">link</Link>
```

**After**

```jsx
<Link href="/route/1">link</Link>
```

In the revised code, the dynamic part of the `href` (`[slug]`) is replaced directly with the actual value (`1`), which simplifies the `href` and makes it a direct path.
