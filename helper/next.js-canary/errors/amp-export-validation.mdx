## Why This Error Occurred

The "AMP Export Validation" error typically occurs during the export process when the AMP pages are validated using the [amphtml-validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/amphtml-validator). If the validator returns any errors, the export process will fail.

AMP validation errors are crucial as they can prevent your pages from being indexed by AMP Caches. AMP Caches are systems that store and serve valid AMP documents to ensure faster delivery of AMP pages to users.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

To resolve this issue, carefully review the error messages provided by the validator. These messages usually provide detailed insights into the problem and how to fix it.
