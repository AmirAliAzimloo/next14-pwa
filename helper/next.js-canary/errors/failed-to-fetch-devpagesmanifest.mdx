title: 'Failed to fetch `devPagesManifest`'
---

## Why This Error Occurred

The network request to load `_devPagesManifest.json` did not succeed.

The dev pages manifest file is used by `next/link` to retrieve the list of pages to be (pre-)loaded by Next.js.
If it fails, Next.js cannot properly navigate and link between pages.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

- Make sure your browser developer tools, extensions, and any other network tools aren't blocking that request.
- If you're running your Next.js application through a proxy, nginx, or other network layer, make sure links like `/_next/*` are configured to be allowed.
